------------------- Create Your Own Alias -------------------	

	
	1. Executing Multiple Commands On Single line 
		
		cmd1 ; cmd2 ; cmd3 ; ............ ;
		
		seperate them with ; 
		
		Ex ls ; cd ./Acad ; man ls
	
	2. Creating own alias for Set of Commands OR Commands ...
		
		alias name=' commands ; ... ; '
		
		Structure alias name='string'
		
		Steps :
			
			a) Check Whether the alias name is not a command by
				using type aliasname
			
			b) 	After the command “alias” we give alias a name followed immediately
				(no whitespace allowed) by an equals sign, followed immediately by a 
				quoted string containing the meaning to be assigned to the name.
			
			c) To remove an alias, the unalias command is used, like so:
				
				unalias name
			
			They vanish when your shell session ends.
