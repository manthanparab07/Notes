------------ Customizing The Prompt ----------------------

	In Linux, the shell prompt is highly configurable.
	
	1. A Default Shell Prompt Looks Like 
		
		hades@hades:~$ 
	
		Components In this Prompt are 
		
			1. UserName	: hades
			2. HostName	: hades
			3. CWD		: ~
	
		The Prompt is defined by environment variable PS1 ( Prompt String 1 ).
	
	2. Contents of PS1 can be viewed using echo command.
		
		echo $PS1
		
		Output :
		
		\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033
		[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$
		
		It Contains Excape Sequence Character i.e characters with \ .
		
	Escape Codes Used In Shell Prompts
	
		\a 	:		ASCII bell. This makes the computer beep when it is encountered.
		\d 	:		Current date in day, month, date format. For example, “Mon May 26.”
		\h 	:		Hostname of the local machine minus the trailing domain name.
		\H 	:		Full hostname.
		\j 	:		Number of jobs running in the current shell session.
		\l 	:		Name of the current terminal device.
		\n 	:		A newline character.
		\s	:		Name of the shell program.
		\t 	:		Current time in 24 hour hours:minutes:seconds format.
		\u 	:		username of the current user.
		\v 	:		Version number of the shell.
		\w	:		Name of the current working directory.
		\W	:		Last part of the current working directory name.
		\! 	:		History number of the current command.
		\# 	:		Number of commands entered during this shell session.
		\$ 	:		This displays a “$” character unless you have superuser privileges.
					In that case, it displays a “#” instead.
		\[ 	:		Signals the start of a series of one or more non-printing characters.
					This is used to embed non-printing control characters which
					manipulate the terminal emulator in some way, such as moving the 
					cursor or changing text colors.
		\]	:		Signals the end of a non-printing character sequence.
		
		
	3. Trying Some Alternative Prompt Designs
		
		Step 1 : Create a backup Copy of existing PS1
		
				ps1_old="$PS1"
		
		Step 2 : Change Prompt String Variable
			
				PS1="....."			.... Excape Codes to be displayed 
		
			Ex. PS1="\$ : "
			
			Now the Shell Prompt :
				
				$ : 
				$ : ls
				
				PS1="\A \h \$ "
				PS1="<\u@\h \W>\$ "
				PS1=" Hello World : "
		
		
	4. Adding Color 
	
		
		Character color is controlled by sending the terminal emulator an ANSI escape
		code embedded in the stream of characters to be displayed.	
		
		The control code does not “print out” on the display, rather it is interpreted
		by the terminal as an instruction.
		
		An ANSI escape code begins with an octal 033 (the code generated by the escape 
		key), followed by an optional character attribute, followed by an instruction.
		
		\033[attribute:colorCode
		
		Attributes	: normal (0) and bold (1) character attributes, text may also be
					  underscore (4), blinking (5)
		
		Sequence	Text Color
		
		\033[0;30m	Black
		\033[0;31m  Red
		\033[0;32m	Green
		\033[0;33m	Brown
		\033[0;34m  Blue
		
		
		attribute 1 in above code will give different color.
		
		For BackGround Codes 
		
		Sequence	Text Color
		
		\033[0;40m	Black
		\033[0;41m  Red
		\033[0;42m	Green
		\033[0;43m	Brown
		\033[0;44m  Blue
		
		
		PS1=\[\033[0;31m \] "\u "
