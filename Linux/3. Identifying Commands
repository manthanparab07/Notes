	4. man 		: Display's Program Manual Page		
		
		Most executable programs intended for command line use provide a formal piece of 
		documentation called a manual or man page. A special paging program called man is 
		used to view them. It is used like this:
	
		man command 		( Executable Commands i.e man mkdir )
		
		man uses less to display the manual page, so all of the familiar
		less commands work while displaying the page.
