-   vi also allows you to place yanks (copied text) into buffers identified by letters.
-   You can fill up to 26 (aâ€“z) buffers with yanked text and restore that text with a put command at any time in your editing session.

|    "[n]"p     | recover last n deletions from the buffer           |
| :-----------: | -------------------------------------------------- |
|               | . will increment the n i.e buffer no.              |
| "\[%\]\[n\]yy | yank n lines into buffer named % -> [a-z]          |
| "\[%\]\[n\]p  | put  n lined from buffer named % after the cursor  |
| "\[%\]\[n\]P  | put  n lined from buffer named % before the cursor |

-   vim is an extension on "ex" editor which used to work on line by line.
-   Useful for editing , moving and copying in bulk
-   ex commands are used in vim by using :command
-   as each ex command requires line address which can be specified using
    1.  Explicit line number
    2.  Symbol which indicate relative position (+-)
    3.  search pattern as address

1.  Explicit Line Number

    |  :3,7d   | delete lines 3 through 7                     |
    | :------: | -------------------------------------------- |
    | :3,7m11  | move lines 3 through 7 to follow line 11     |
    | :3,7co11 | copy lines 3 through 7 and put after line 11 |

2.  |      Pattern       | Information                                                  |
    | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    |        :%d         | delete all the lines from the file                           |
    |                    |                                                              |
    |    :/pattern/d     | Delete the next line containing pattern                      |
    |    :/pattern/+d    | Delete the line below containing the patter                  |
    |                    | Global Search                                                |
    |     :g/pattern     | Moves to the last Occurrence of the pattern                  |
    |    :g/pattern/p    | find and display all the lines with the pattern              |
    |   :g!/pattern/p    | finds and display all the lines without the pattern          |
    | :60,124g/pattern/p | Finds and displays any lines between lines 60 and 124 containing pattern. |
    |                    |                                                              |
    |                    |                                                              |

-   Multiple ex command are separated by |

    ```bash
    :/s/pattern/string | set nu | ... |
    ```

    

#### -- Editing between files
 As named buffer are not cleared when a new file is loaded into the vi buffer thus allowing copy , moving across various files

        "f4yy -> :w -> :e filename -> "fp

 Copies 4 lines from current file to filename using named buffer f



#### -- Global Replacement

 

|   :s/old/new/    | replace first occurrence on current line        |
| :--------------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
|   :s/old/new/g   | replace all   occurrence on current line        |
| :2,7s/old/new/g  | replace all occurrence between line 2 and 7     |
| :1,$s/old/new/g  | replace all occurrence from the file            |
|  :%s/old/new/g   | replace all occurrence from the file            |
| :1,$s/old/new/gc | confirm before replace occurrence from the file |
|                  |                                                 |


â€‹          

#### -- Context Sensitive Replacement

-   Useful to first find lines matching a pattern and then operating on matched lines only
     Ex. find all those files whose size > 4096 replace user with user1

```
 :g/pattern/s/old/new/g 
```

-   first g tells that it should operate on entire file and then last g indicates that it should operate on all occurrence on each file.

-   Similarly d , mo , co can be used to instead

### Executing Linux Commands

-   You can display or read in the results of any Unix command while you are editing in
    vim . 
-   An exclamation mark ( ! ) tells ex to create a shell and to regard what follows as a
    Unix command:

```bash
:!command
```

-   In order to execute multiple commands run :!bash

#### You can combine :read with a call to Unix, to read the results of a Unix command into your file. 

```bash
:r !date
```

-   It will read in the systemâ€™s date information into the text of your file.
-    By preceding the :r command with a line address, you can read the result of the command in at any desired point in your file.
-   By default, it will appear after the current line.
-   The result of linux command is written into the file.

```
:r !linux_commands
```

```
:r ! ls | sort | grep Do
```

### Filtering Text Through a Command

-   Filtering text with ex

    ```bahs
    96,99!sort
    .,+2!sort
    .,$!sort
    ```

    

### Marking Places in VIM

-   Allows us to define certain point which can be referred with a case sensitive character.

-   Place markers are set only during the current vi session; they are not stored in the file.

-   |  mx  | Marks the current position with x (x can be any letter) case sensitive |
    | :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    |  'x  | (Apostrophe.) Moves the cursor to the first character of the line marked by x. |
    |  `x  | (Back-quote.) Moves the cursor to the character marked by x. |
    |  ``  | (Backquotes.) Returns to the exact position of the previous mark or context after a move. |
    |  ''  | (Apostrophes.) Returns to the beginning of the line of the previous mark or context. |

     

### Multiple Window Of Vim

-   To open multiple windows from the command line, use Vimâ€™s -o option. For example:

    ```bash
    Vim -o file1 file2
    ```

| vim -o file1 file2  | Splits the window horizontally                               |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| vim -O file1 file2  | Splits window vertically                                     |
| vim -o5 file1 file2 | Pre allocates 5 windows for editing                          |
| :split [filename]   | splits the current window **horizontally** into two half both showing same file if filename not provided |
| :vsplit [filename]  | splits the current window **vertically** into two half both showing same file if filename not provided |
|                     |                                                              |
| 3^Wx                | Swap the cursor with the 3rd window                          |
| ^Wx                 | Swap the cursor with the next window                         |
|                     |                                                              |
|                     |                                                              |

### Tabbed Editing

-   Vim lets you create new tabs, each of which behaves independently. In each tab
    you can split the screen, edit multiple files.

| :tabnew [ filename ] | Open a new tab and edit a file |
| :------------------: | ------------------------------ |
|      :tabclose       | closes current tab             |
